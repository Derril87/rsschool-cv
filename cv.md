## Summary statement:

My journey as a programmer began three years ago with online courses on the UDEMY platform. Within the first year, I completed courses in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and started applying my skills by creating personal pet projects. However, I soon realized that I needed a deeper understanding to build full-fledged applications.

To improve my skills, I enrolled in a one-year full-stack developer program at the PASV coding school, where I expanded my knowledge of React and backend development. During this time, I built several basic projects and applications, learned how to work with APIs and JSON, and later joined an internship where we studied the principles of a custom-built CRM system.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into backend technologies, exploring modern frameworks, and practicing algorithmic problems involving trees, graphs, and linked lists.

I am determined, persistent, and resilient — qualities that help me stay on track and overcome challenges. I’m always striving to improve my skills, become the best at what I do, and collaborate and share knowledge with my peers in both educational and work environments.

## Code review:

### KATA from LeetCode - Two sum:

_Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice._

```js
function(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let diff = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(diff)) {
      return [i, map.get(diff)];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```
